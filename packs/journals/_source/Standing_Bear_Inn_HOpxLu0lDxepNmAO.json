        "content": "<p>Brewing ale is a simple process. Most of the ale consumed on Hârn is made in small batches in the kitchens of an inn or tavern or by village alewives. There are few places where large amounts of ale are needed all at the same time. The Olokand tournament is one of them.</p>\n<p>Most ale is consumed fresh, directly out of the fermenters. However, during events such as a tournament, the brewery can’t produce ale fast enough to meet the demand. Large amounts of extra ale are produced in the months before the tournament, put into hogsheads, and stored in the inn’s cool cellar.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>The numbers in square brackets refer to locations in the brewery; see</em> @UUID[JournalEntry.0R9Km6jDsZZOtN7V.JournalEntryPage.59Oe909KUFcLtdNr]{Brewery}.</p>\n<h2>Hugo’s Secret Process</h2>\n<p>The Standing Bear Inn brewery produces ale on a large scale and uses techniques not commonly employed by the small home brews made fresh daily by alewives. Hugo of Bardenas’ strong, or aged, ale is a popular treat with visitors to the tournament. Many brewers have tried unsuccessfully to uncover his secret.</p>\n<p>The first step in brewing is the preparation of the malt and oats. Barley or other grains are soaked in water, drained, and kept moist. They are turned twice a day for 3–5 days until they germinate. They are then dried in a warm oven for 6–8 hours and roasted in a hot oven for 4–6 hours [5]. The malt is cooled and put in barrels. Oats are partially ground in the local mill. The hulls are separated from the oat grains, or groats, which are then crushed under a second set of millstones. When it is ready to brew, the malt is hand milled to break open the grain and dry mixed with the crushed oats.</p>\n<p>The second step is creation of the wort. Water is carried in buckets from the internal well and dumped in two large copper kettles [6]. The water is brought to a boil using a wood-fired oven [5]. The malt and oat mixture is added to the mash tun on top of a false bottom [4]. A hollow log is used to add boiling water under the false bottom, saturating the grain mixture from the bottom up. The mash is left to soak for a short time. More boiling water is added to the top of the mix and the mash is stirred well, then covered and left to cool overnight. The liquid that comes from this process is called wort.</p>\n<p>Fermenting the wort is the third step. A wooden valve below the false bottom of the mash tun is opened to allow the cool wort to flow out. The false bottom catches most of the mash; a bag full of straw filters out any remaining solids. The wort flows via a wooden trough to the fermenters [3]. The walls and floor of the open fermenters contain the dregs of the previous batches, including naturally occurring yeast. It takes three days for the yeast to convert the sugars in the wort into alcohol, resulting in “green” ale, the way most people drink it.</p>\n<p>Hugo’s secret fourth step is secondary fermentation. After the green beer is put in casks and moved to the cellar, Hugo performs one more step than not even his journeyman or apprentice are allowed to see. Hugo and Jonil add a jug of honey, herbs, and foam gathered from the top of the fermenter to each cask. This results in a second fermentation that increases the alcohol quantity and gives the strong ale a distinctive taste and effervescence. There is enough demand for this strong ale that Hugo does small batches for sale throughout the rest of the year.</p>",

These are based in Tashal (Semethshire and Thelshire), Gardiren (Nephshire and Meselyneshire), Kiban (Balimshire), Minarsas (Vemionshire), and Qualdris (Oselshire).</p>\n<p>The Council of Masters for each guild is typically drawn by lot. This council then nominates one of their own as Guildmaster. The Guildmaster can act for the guild as required and casts the deciding vote whenever a council matter is tied.</p>\n<p>The Innkeepers’ Guild of Northern Kaldor has traditionally identified itself as the districts of Serelind and Nurelia, corresponding to the northernmost of the Four Kingdoms that predated the founding of Kaldor. In practice, these boundaries correspond to the shires of Neph and Meselyne. Longstanding tradition has dictated that the position of Guildmaster alternates between a master in Gardiren and Olokand. Currently, the Innkeepers’ Guildmaster is Trivin of Jasath, who operates the Jug Inn in Gardiren.</p>\n<p>Haselun expects that he will be nominated as Guildmaster following the end of Trivin’s current term. However, several of the masters are uncomfortable with the prospect of him as Guildmaster and are actively engaged in a search for a viable alternative. Master Innkeeper Sendalyn of Dirath, proprietor of the Kald &amp; Castle inn, has made it clear that he has no interest in serving as Guildmaster. This has led some to openly advocate for breaking with tradition and selecting a Guildmaster from one of the smaller settlements. There has also been considerable discussion around whether it is time for have a Guildmaster for each shire.</p>",

The innkeeper, Haselun of Elathel, caters to patrons with the means to pay for this distinction. For most of the year, the clientele includes wealthy guildsmen, caravan masters, well-off travelers, and Olokand’s more affluent locals.</p>\n<p>During the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry in Larane, the Standing Bear is reserved for nobility and their retainers. The inn is close to the general public while the nobles are in residence, although food and drink are still sold from windows facing Mycepris Square.</p>\n<p>Freemaster ostler Narandin of Othendel is an expert horse healer with a reputation for saving animals that others consider hopeless.</p>\n<p>The inn is a two-story, half-framed building with an attic and cellar. Numerous shuttered windows line the exterior of both floors. The roof is tiled with wooden shingles and there are five stone chimneys. Three entrances, including the main one off Mycepris square, feature solid oak doors with good quality hinges. Overall, the structure is in good condition and has been well maintained since it was constructed in 670. The inn’s sign is a painted board depicting its namesake, a standing black bear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Pricelist</h2>\n<h3>Services and Accommodations</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Use of a private dining room, per watch</strong></td>\n<td>6d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Table candle, per night</strong></td>\n<td>1d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Servants sleeping on common room floor, per night</strong></td>\n<td>2f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Sleeping in the ostler’s hayloft, per night</strong></td>\n<td>2f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Straw pallet for servants, per night</strong></td>\n<td>2f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Dormitory, per night</strong></td>\n<td>6f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Bull Room, per night</strong></td>\n<td>6d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Boar or Eagle Room, per night</strong></td>\n<td>8d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Fox Room, per night</strong></td>\n<td>10d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Stag Room, per night</strong></td>\n<td>12d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Lion Room, per night</strong></td>\n<td>15d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Bear Room, per night</strong></td>\n<td>18d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Candle and jug of washing water</strong></td>\n<td>1f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Hot bath in the tub, per person</strong></td>\n<td>4d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Fresh bed linens, per bed</strong></td>\n<td>1d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Laundry, per item</strong></td>\n<td>2f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Stabling for riding horse, per night</strong></td>\n<td>2d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Stabling of war horse, per night</strong></td>\n<td>3d</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Libations</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Standing Bear Ale</strong></td>\n<td>2f/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Hugo’s Special Ale</strong></td>\n<td>3f/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Haniale</strong></td>\n<td>3f/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Dunon Stout</strong></td>\n<td>1d/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Alwynan Cider</strong></td>\n<td>6f/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Honey Bear Mead</strong></td>\n<td>2d/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Saint Bromel’s Perry</strong></td>\n<td>2d/pint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Verelim White Wine (Shorkyne)</strong></td>\n<td>2d/goblet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Kiblerana White Wine (Emela)</strong></td>\n<td>6d/goblet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Coranan Red, Trierzi Black, or Mekonem Red Wine</strong></td>\n<td>1d/goblet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Mulled Wine</strong></td>\n<td>3d/goblet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Golden Maiden Brandy</strong></td>\n<td>5d/goblet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Uisgebagh (Jarin Whiskey)</strong></td>\n<td>6d/goblet</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Bread and Cheese</strong></td>\n<td>3f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Dried Fruit</strong></td>\n<td>1f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Eggs and Sausage</strong></td>\n<td>1d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Meat Pie/Pastie</strong></td>\n<td>3f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Porridge</strong></td>\n<td>2f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Pottage</strong></td>\n<td>6f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Roast Chicken</strong></td>\n<td>6f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Roast Mutton</strong></td>\n<td>5f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Roast Pork</strong></td>\n<td>2d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Rooast Rabbit</strong></td>\n<td>6f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Soup</strong></td>\n<td>3f</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Stew</strong></td>\n<td>1d</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Brewery</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Hogshead</strong></td>\n<td>90d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Pipe</strong></td>\n<td>162d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50%\"><strong>Tun</strong></td>\n<td>294d</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Food and Drink Descriptions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standing Bear Ale:</strong> The standard ale served at the inn.

        "content": "<p>The Standing Bear Inn is a \"Location Module\"; it is designed to depict the Standing Bear Inn in the city of Olokand, kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the HârnWorld fantasy setting; however, this Inn could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.</p>\n<p>This module is based on the \"Standing Bear Inn\" fanon; please see @UUID[JournalEntry.HOpxLu0lDxepNmAO.JournalEntryPage.v1cnsjdBEfpqGsVK]{Credits} for more information.</p>\n<p>This module was designed for use with the <a title=\"HarnMaster 3 System for Foundry VTT\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3\">HârnMaster</a> system, but is mostly system agnostic so it can be used with any system (except the Actors, which are specific to the HârnMaster system).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using this module with Non-HârnMaster systems</h2>\n<p>This entire module is system-agnostic, with the exception of the Actors.  In non-HârnMaster systems, you will have to create your own versions of these NPCs so that they work with your system.  In order to facilitate this, each of the NPCs has a detailed journal entry describing the character.  This will facilitate creating compatible characters within the desired system.</p>\n<p>See the section \"NPCs\" below for links to each of the characters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Using the Scenes</h2>\n<p>Many of the scenes depict multi-level buildings.  Multiple levels have been included for the Stables and Brewery scenes, to reduce the number of scenes that must be managed.  The inn is different: there is one scene for each floor of the Inn.  For each level of each building, map markers have been used to provide details on that particular location.</p>\n<p>The use of the <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/multilevel-tokens/\">Multilevel Tokens</a> module is optional.  In both the Inn and the Brewery, areas have been designated as stairways between levels.  If the Multilevel Tokens module is enabled, tokens will be automatically moved from one floor to another (possibly moving between scenes) when they enter the stairways.  If Multilevel Tokens is not enabled, then tokens will need to be moved manually.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The original maps from The Standing Bear Inn were used in this module.  These maps were not originally designed to fit on a 5' square grid, so they do not exactly fit within such grid spacing.  For this reason, grids are not used in these scenes, so tokens can be moved more freely.</span></h3>\n<p>The scene \"Inn Yard\" provides a general overview and battlemap of the grounds around the Inn, and should probably be the main and first map your players see.  Note that although walls have been placed in the interiors of the buildings in the Inn Yard scene, <strong><em>it is not recommended to use the building interiors in the Inn Yard scene</em></strong>.  If the characters enter a building, then switch to the scene for that specific building and use the building interior there instead.</p>\n<h3>Map Notes</h3>\n<p>The scenes make extensive use of Map Notes to provide detailed description of important areas in the scenes. To view these map notes, click on the \"bookmark icon\" in the canvas toolbar. Map notes are not visible to players, only to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Text and Markings</h3>\n<p>In various areas text and or markings have been provided in the scenes to assist the GM. Generally this information is set to only be visible to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Stairs</h3>\n<p>Some stairs may have an arrow indicating the direction the stairs descend. When present these arrows are visible to all players.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>To control ambient lighting, use the \"darkness\" setting for the scene.</p>\n<p>All scenes have been setup with Unrestricted Vision Range enabled, with a Vision Limitation Threshold set to 0.7. This allows all areas of the scene to be lit during the day, but vision is limited and lights are required at night.</p>\n<p>Internal lamps and candle lights have been placed in indoor areas. These lights have been set to enable when the \"darkness\" setting is ≥ 0.2, that is, just after things start becoming dim.</p>\n<p>Hârn has a cool climate, so all fireplaces and braziers are constantly lit.</p>\n<h3>Elevation Marks</h3>\n<p>At various locations on the maps are numbers such as \"+1\", \"+8\", \"-6\", etc.  These numbers represent the elevation of that point in feet relative to ground level.  This should assist in recognizing heights of various floors and elements.  In some cases, there may be a number with a hat or horizontal line above the number: this represents the height of the ceiling at that point (the hat represents a peaked ceiling, the horizontal line represents a flat ceiling).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recommended Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules, although not required, are highly recommended to enhance this module:</p>\n<p><strong>Compendium Folders: </strong>Due to the large number of journal entries in this module, these journal entries have been organized into sub-folders using Compendium Folders. If Compendium Folders is not used, these will all show up as a single long list of Journal Entries in the compendium. As long as you follow the links starting with the Overview journal entry, it should not be necessary to navigate the compendium, but if you want to navigate through the Journal Entries yourself, having Compendium Folders will greately simplify this task.</p>\n<p><strong>Backgroundless Pins:</strong> The map note icons all have a dark grey background; with this module, that background disappears. This may increase your enjoyment of the maps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Inn</h2>\n<p>For details of the Inn, see @UUID[JournalEntry.HOpxLu0lDxepNmAO.JournalEntryPage.ojvvwVJz2TJrMlZ6]{The Standing Bear Inn}.</p>\n<h3>Cellar</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.XMjjTzSyU18AlgQn]{[S01] Ramp}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.icIkZ4TElBl9u7Pg]{[S02] Internal Well}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.qYhSyehy562gYrfj]{[S03] Cellar}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ground Floor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.5dbFXfU0SgdgcOW0]{[S11] Square Entrance}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.Yktu42xSahkrVQmL]{[S12] Common Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.NKD7AxibQhgzz1AK]{[S13] The Great Hearth}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.g1TTy6ad2vWGkQKT]{[S14] Private Dining Rooms}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.ae6BzcuJF6KykYA0]{[S15] Cloak Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.K9cUQJvu7LdcOQdr]{[S16] Kitchen Entrance}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.pzS3ghihg4HcVHcY]{[S17] Innkeeper’s Quarters}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.Hbte8GyczQorO0Zn]{[S18] Main Kitchen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.mtEK1ZNUXH2t0Fau]{[S19] Tourney Kitchen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.48wg5cFhGJyHqk2f]{[S1A] Bar}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.yW0TQiFHrb5bR1gT]{[S1B] Access Ramp}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.XDAgTsV8qO4waVEi]{[S1C] Courtyard Entrance}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Second Floor</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">The second floor of the inn contains the private guest rooms, all identified with various heraldic beasts painted on the doors.

These rooms are popular with wealthy nobles and often are reserved months in advance. There are five additional rooms of varying sizes, each with multiple beds. These are less richly furnished but still quite comfortable. They are often vacant for large portions of the year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.Y8PIm6RoMPKRx73s]{[S21] Corridor}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.YsGVHm5jvuQBy0zJ]{[S22] Lion Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.ShTJsGLlJDWSFN7q]{[S23] Stag Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.4yJZcfdVIOMmFsV0]{[S24] Bear Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.KU4309CDhZ2TLeRx]{[S25] Bull Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.0m8G9NivXhU00IEd]{[S26] Boar Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.YMKPKtvdRYl4gmqx]{[S27] Horse Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.xYaAXTruBl1rknUr]{[S28] Eagle Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.wUWfctOSgcUVCrXF]{[S29] Fox Room}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attic</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.Od88MqzpEdoKbdIM]{[S31] Seasonal Staff Quarters}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.jkVk6upnvlCeWcuE.JournalEntryPage.evV2gVS8CrTtBuLm]{[S32] Dormitory}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Brewery</h2>\n<p>See also: @UUID[JournalEntry.HOpxLu0lDxepNmAO.JournalEntryPage.ngcRTz3U9zc2ovbW]{Brewing Ale}</p>\n<h3>Ground Floor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.zInYTUmkLziVWIil]{[B1] Warehouse}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.aFHXnPtSbXG8waJu]{[B2] Tourney Bar}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.hRnhr7rGl47gm5OH]{[B3] Fermenters}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.qOyTpkVn5VhMv6dz]{[B4] Mash Tuns}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.KAk8BCF6jmpZflF3]{[B5] Ovens}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Second Floor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.vCOUxQHXAgEQ1B7n]{[B6] Brew Kettles}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.Xt7cMVqZUuyavw3C]{[B7] Brewmaster’s Hall}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.12oNlkjr4b871IwZ]{[B8] Staff Quarters}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.Vow5jNId6PH2a1iF.JournalEntryPage.kBTf4G4gihE7VUhi]{[B9] Private Quarters}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Stables</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.URWmGjbfwo5HcQTT.JournalEntryPage.WXjvJI9n6LqYsnSk]{[H1] Stable}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.URWmGjbfwo5HcQTT.JournalEntryPage.FKx9MDrUG7nZxXvi]{[H2] Ostler’s Quarters}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.URWmGjbfwo5HcQTT.JournalEntryPage.OSUWEPFtksuExZCn]{[H3] Stables - Hayloft}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Wedding Party:</strong> A number of important guests arrive for a wedding to be held in the chapel of Caer Olokand. Haselun suspects the young couple is plotting to run away, however, and asks the PCs to help keep an eye on them.</li>\n<li><strong>The Guilded Cage:</strong> Haselun hears a rumor that the regional guild has sent someone to covertly investigate his franchise. He employs the PCs to help him determine which of the guests is the spy.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t Mention the War!</strong> A group of knights from the Order of the Lady of Paladins arrives for the tournament. Only after they are in their rooms does Haselun realize they are from Chybisa. Now, he is desperate to keep them and the Venilana apart and looks to the PCs for help.</li>\n<li><strong>Carnival Arcane:</strong> A mysterious guest arrives, drawing Haselun’s suspicion with his desire to arrange a private meeting with other “weird” folk. The innkeeper enlists the PCs to find out who these strangers really are, not realizing he’s intruding on a meeting of several Shek-Pvar.</li>\n<li><strong>One Corpse Too Many:</strong> A guest dies in his room. Not wishing to alarm the other guests, Haselun gives the PCs the unpleasant task of removing the body discreetly.</li>\n<li><strong>I Smell a Rat:</strong> A ratter is called in to handle the pests as guests arrive for the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry. Unfortunately, some of his poison is mixed up with the trays of food prepared for the guests. Haselun is frantic to find and remove the poisoned tray without arousing the fears of the assembled nobles, but the correct tray can only be identified with a close inspection. With time running short, he enlists the PCs to help find and get rid of the poisoned food before a disaster occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Bear Necessities:</strong> The life-size wooden statue of the inn’s namesake standing bear is accidently damaged while cleaning. Haselun is trying to avoid Wynda discovering the damage and asks the PCs to help find a way to repair or replace it before she finds out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>NPCs</h2>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the links for journal entries should work for all systems, the actor links will only work for those using the HârnMaster system.</p>\n</section>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:13em\">Name</th>\n<th style=\"width:13em\">Occupation</th>\n<th style=\"width:15em\">Journal Link</th>\n<th>Actor Link</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Caelan of Marwydd</td>\n<td>Salter/Seasonal Help</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.4UPs35Q2KloCR2P8]{Caelan of Marwydd}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.FqF2m8mQZWXHttJs]{327-1 Salter - Caelan of Marwydd}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Esyra of Ghel</td>\n<td>Head Cook</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.2YHGAdqho0cc1HHS]{Esyra of Khel}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.gASqz9WQDfmV3ttY]{312-4 Innkeeper - Esyra of Ghel}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Faera of Kirst</td>\n<td>Journeyman Innkeeper</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.DkzqmMov5CuWRERe]{Faera of Kirst}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.7EUVT1LmOwn7DEun]{312-3 Innkeeper - Faera of Kirst}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Haethen \"One-Eye\" </td>\n<td>Huscarl</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.mBFAlANL0iyGi43k]{Haethen \"One-Eye\"}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.vZHiah0fX4rzTMik]{125-2 Huscarl MF - Haethen “One-Eye”}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Haselun of Elathel</td>\n<td>Master Innkeeper</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.Ef6K6NoGJMWGhxkt]{Haselun of Elathel}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.HLDNbWNIX1y379Pl]{312-2 Innkeeper - Haselun of Elathel}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hugo of Bardenas</td>\n<td>Brewmaster</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.SXMhmnjx9SBkAndC]{Hugo of Bardenas}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.0mBhVvGVmbtahtrI]{312-6 Innkeeper - Hugo of Bardenas}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kym of Dorsey</td>\n<td>Bartender/ Bouncer</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.ZIQqiISLZro94X4D]{Kym of Dorsey}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.NHKtRXQzbIT3efj2]{312-5 Innkeeper - Kym of Dorsey}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Naradin of Othendel</td>\n<td>Ostler</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.xmQxFyh09yjGgWZw]{Naradin of Othendel}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.5VOfz7u8YsKj68M4]{322-4 Ostler - Narandin of Othendel}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sir Kaltric Darsyme</td>\n<td>Patron/Knight</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.fXTG8PMDI7UGQc04]{Sir Kaltric Darsyme}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.MzUC2NfThZZYveXB]{506-5 Feudal Knight MH - Sir Kaltric Darsyme}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sir Rablar Tesael</td>\n<td>Patron/Knight</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.52WyI6BvliaSkllJ]{Sir Rablar Tesael}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.h51VNZyJs1bL9e2P]{506-6 Feudal Knight MH - Sir Rablar Tesael}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sir Gowen Karondal</td>\n<td>Patron/Retired Knight</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.nBsDlL6J6IVAAeql]{Sir Gowen Karondal}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.0NCGw1AjKnt0noH7]{507-8 Fighting Order MH - Sir Gowen Karondal}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wynda of Elathel</td>\n<td>Assistant Innkeeper</td>\n<td>@UUID[JournalEntry.KZTsZFjCqJA6zHAo.JournalEntryPage.x33RAZ6kTlGxFYOy]{Wynda of Elathel}</td>\n<td>@UUID[Actor.8gZIOwnaKw0Dx1T8]{399-3 Other guild - Wynda of Elathel}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
