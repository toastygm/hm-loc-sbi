{"_id":"NLc743LXrxafldA5","name":"Important NPCs","content":"<h1>Inn</h1>\n<h2>Haselun of Elathel, Master Innkeeper</h2>\n<p>Haselun, 38, is a snobbish, pessimistic misanthrope who aspires to become an accepted member of more “respectable” social circles. He sees the successful running of the Standing Bear as a means of achieving this dream. He displays a fawning deference for nobility, especially during the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry. His treatment of noble guests stands in stark contrast with the spiteful and abusive behavior he often directs at commoners, who he essentially despises. Since the Standing Bear is quite popular with travelers, merchants, and wealthy locals throughout the rest of the year, Haselun often struggles with the need to be pleasant to wealthy commoners. As his wife has sarcastically commented, “he could run a much better inn if he didn’t have all the guests getting in the way.”</p>\n<p>A staunch traditionalist in most respects, Haselun openly disdains the customs and behaviors of many of his common-born guests, and virtually all of his staff. His wife does her best to mitigate this but is frequently exasperated by his failings and becomes verbally abusive. Haselun is intimidated by her temper and goes to desperate lengths to avoid it, creating impromptu, ill- conceived ruses to distract her from whatever mess he’s created.</p>\n<p>Haselun’s schemes often require the reluctant cooperation of his staff, who are also the usual targets of his frustrations. During the busy summer season, he hires a number of additional workers, many of whom are part of the refugee population that fled Orbaal following the Jarin Rebellion of 703 and settled in Meselyneshire with the blessing of the sheriff. Although subjects of the crown, Haselun regards them as “migrant foreigners.”</p>\n<p>Haselun is currently the leader of the Olokand Mangai, which meets monthly but has little influence with the sheriff, Sir Maldan Harabor. For his part, Sir Maldan tries to keep interactions with Haselun as brief and infrequent as possible, preferring to relay messages through subordinates. This distresses Haselun, who tries in vain to impress the sheriff, “even if he is a bastard.”</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.HLDNbWNIX1y379Pl]{312-2 Innkeeper - Haselun of Elathel}</p>\n<h2>Wynda of Elathel, Assistant Innkeeper</h2>\n<p>Wynda, 40, is Haselun’s wife and de facto assistant innkeeper. She is, in many respects, a much more effective innkeeper than her husband, being far more concerned with the profitability of the inn than with the social status of the guests. She calmly navigates whatever crisis arises and is quite down-to-earth and efficient.</p>\n<p>Wynda’s skill has frequently prevented disaster when Haselun’s behavior goes too far. On the occasions when her unflappable demeanor cracks, her temper is rarely directed at anyone but her husband. Her fury typically consists of verbal abuse. She has, on occasion, become so infuriated that she’s resorted to physical violence. Haselun is cowed by her temper and tries his best to avoid it, flinching when she barks his name. He’s commented that she is capable of felling a man at ten paces with one of her looks, and refers to her, behind her back, by a variety of epithets, such as “my darling basilisk,” “the gargun queen,” and “lady of dragons.”</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.8gZIOwnaKw0Dx1T8]{399-3 Other guild - Wynda of Elathel}</p>\n<h2>Faera of Kirst, Journeyman Innkeeper</h2>\n<p>Faera, 22, is an attractive young woman who acts as a server, chambermaid, and general assistant. She is quite competent and level-headed. Her natural talent for languages (she is fluent in Jarinese and Orbaalese) makes her indispensable. Despite her better judgment, her loyalty to Haselun has seen her swept up into his antics on several occasions.</p>\n<p>Her Ilviran faith comes out in her artistic pursuits; she often sketches portraits of staff or guests, and occasionally sells them for additional money. She is teaching herself to paint, a skill that Haselun derides as a waste of time.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.7EUVT1LmOwn7DEun]{312-3 Innkeeper - Faera of Kirst}</p>\n<h1>Stables</h1>\n<h2>Naradin of Othendel</h2>\n<p>Narandin, 56, is a freemaster ostler who operates the stables in partnership with the inn. He and his two assistants tend to the stabling, care, and feeding of guests’ animals, as well as more general ostler’s services for the settlement.</p>\n<p>During the Royal Chelebin Tournament, Narandin hires additional help to manage the routine tasks while he is kept busy attending to warhorses injured during jousts or other contests.</p>\n<p>Since childhood, Narandin has possessed a special gift of empathy for animals, especially horses. Speaking quietly, he is able to calm and assure them with remarkable ease; few are able to replicate his success. An expert at veterinary care, Narandin is well regarded for his skill at healing horses. His reputation for saving animals that others consider beyond hope ensures that he has a steady supply of work.</p>\n<p>Tall and lanky, with gray hair and a beard, Narandin is never seen without his favorite leather hat and a bright red scarf tied around his neck.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.5VOfz7u8YsKj68M4]{322-4 Ostler - Narandin of Othendel}</p>\n<h1>Brewery</h1>\n<h2>Hugo of Bardenas</h2>\n<p>Hugo the brewmaster is originally from Aleath in Kanday and is the uncle of Urso of Bardenas [Aleath B15]. A master innkeeper himself, Hugo’s true passion is brewing ale. He and his nephew both learned the skill from his father (Urso’s grandfather), who traveled extensively and brought back several new techniques. Like Urso, Hugo is a massive man, although a good life and plenty of ale have caused him to put on a bit of fat as he ages. Still immensely strong, Hugo is 6’4” and 260 lb. Now in his 60s, he still slings sacks of grain and manhandles barrels of ale with remarkable ease.</p>\n<p>Hugo is well liked in the community. His pleasant demeanor, quiet and polite nature, and quick wit with a joke have earned him many friends. These same characteristics and his intimidating strength have made him completely and utterly immune to Haselun’s ranting and raving. Hugo and Wynda get along famously. It is their combined abilities that thwart Haselun’s most idiotic ideas.</p>\n<p>Although technically bonded to Haselun’s franchise, Hugo runs the brewery almost as a separate establishment. He knows exactly what is needed to prepare for the tournament. He orders his own materials and starts brewing when he is ready to and not a moment before.</p>\n<p>Hugo’s “companion” is a middle-aged man named Jonil of Sarion. Originally from the Gardiren area, Jonil works in the brewery. He is a journeyman innkeeper and the assistant brewer but has never sought master status. Most townsfolk suspect that Jonil is more than an employee but the two are discreet. Hugo’s popularity quells most questions. In fact, the two have been lovers for more than 30 years and Jonil is the reason Hugo settled in Kaldor.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.0mBhVvGVmbtahtrI]{312-6 Innkeeper - Hugo of Bardenas}</p>\n<h1>Seasonal Help</h1>\n<p>During the summer months, the increased caravan traffic and the Royal Chelebin Tournament of Chivalry create a demand that far exceeds the capacity of the inn’s usual staff. During these times, the staff can more than double with the hiring of seasonal help. Some return each year, but there are always some new faces.</p>\n<h2>Caelan of Marwydd</h2>\n<p>A Jarin man in his mid- to late-20s, Caelan is outwardly a well-meaning but confused immigrant from Orbaal with a poor grasp of Hârnic. While the language barrier leads to some misunderstandings, he has proven to be a hard worker, eager to please and seemingly oblivious to Haselun’s prejudices. He holds the rank of journeyman, acting as a server, helping to move the baggage of nobles, and performing a variety of tasks around the busy inn.</p>\n<p>In reality, Caelan is a skilled agent of the Aenghysa, a Jarin resistance group. Although the group’s activities are largely confined to Orbaal, Caelan was sent south to spy on the nobles of Kaldor and make arrangements with the local Lia-Kavair (see Olokand #11) for the smuggling of weapons in exchange for proscribed drugs from the north. His confused foreigner act is quite skillful and few give him credit for being anything more, nor do they tend to be as guarded in their conversations when he is nearby.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.FqF2m8mQZWXHttJs]{327-1 Salter - Caelan of Marwydd}</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.1zhidN4Jlxw5JBCY"}}}

{"_id":"stnZglVg35ddCWyS","name":"Brewing Ale","content":"<p>Brewing ale is a simple process. Most of the ale consumed on Hârn is made in small batches in the kitchens of an inn or tavern or by village alewives. There are few places where large amounts of ale are needed all at the same time. The Olokand tournament is one of them.</p>\n<p>Most ale is consumed fresh, directly out of the fermenters. However, during events such as a tournament, the brewery can’t produce ale fast enough to meet the demand. Large amounts of extra ale are produced in the months before the tournament, put into hogsheads, and stored in the inn’s cool cellar.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>The numbers in square brackets refer to locations in the brewery; see</em> @Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-locations.PuQaomBLi1zo4mco]{Brewery}.</p>\n<h2>Hugo’s Secret Process</h2>\n<p>The Standing Bear Inn brewery produces ale on a large scale and uses techniques not commonly employed by the small home brews made fresh daily by alewives. Hugo of Bardenas’ strong, or aged, ale is a popular treat with visitors to the tournament. Many brewers have tried unsuccessfully to uncover his secret.</p>\n<p>The first step in brewing is the preparation of the malt and oats. Barley or other grains are soaked in water, drained, and kept moist. They are turned twice a day for 3–5 days until they germinate. They are then dried in a warm oven for 6–8 hours and roasted in a hot oven for 4–6 hours [5]. The malt is cooled and put in barrels. Oats are partially ground in the local mill. The hulls are separated from the oat grains, or groats, which are then crushed under a second set of millstones. When it is ready to brew, the malt is hand milled to break open the grain and dry mixed with the crushed oats.</p>\n<p>The second step is creation of the wort. Water is carried in buckets from the internal well and dumped in two large copper kettles [6]. The water is brought to a boil using a wood-fired oven [5]. The malt and oat mixture is added to the mash tun on top of a false bottom [4]. A hollow log is used to add boiling water under the false bottom, saturating the grain mixture from the bottom up. The mash is left to soak for a short time. More boiling water is added to the top of the mix and the mash is stirred well, then covered and left to cool overnight. The liquid that comes from this process is called wort.</p>\n<p>Fermenting the wort is the third step. A wooden valve below the false bottom of the mash tun is opened to allow the cool wort to flow out. The false bottom catches most of the mash; a bag full of straw filters out any remaining solids. The wort flows via a wooden trough to the fermenters [3]. The walls and floor of the open fermenters contain the dregs of the previous batches, including naturally occurring yeast. It takes three days for the yeast to convert the sugars in the wort into alcohol, resulting in “green” ale, the way most people drink it.</p>\n<p>Hugo’s secret fourth step is secondary fermentation. After the green beer is put in casks and moved to the cellar, Hugo performs one more step than not even his journeyman or apprentice are allowed to see. Hugo and Jonil add a jug of honey, herbs, and foam gathered from the top of the fermenter to each cask. This results in a second fermentation that increases the alcohol quantity and gives the strong ale a distinctive taste and effervescence. There is enough demand for this strong ale that Hugo does small batches for sale throughout the rest of the year.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.x6omMImZNwWSxzyj"}}}

In practice, these boundaries correspond to the shires of Neph and Meselyne. Longstanding tradition has dictated that the position of Guildmaster alternates between a master in Gardiren and Olokand. Currently, the Innkeepers’ Guildmaster is Trivin of Jasath, who operates the Jug Inn in Gardiren.</p>\n<p>Haselun expects that he will be nominated as Guildmaster following the end of Trivin’s current term. However, several of the masters are uncomfortable with the prospect of him as Guildmaster and are actively engaged in a search for a viable alternative. Master Innkeeper Sendalyn of Dirath, proprietor of the Kald &amp; Castle inn, has made it clear that he has no interest in serving as Guildmaster. This has led some to openly advocate for breaking with tradition and selecting a Guildmaster from one of the smaller settlements. There has also been considerable discussion around whether it is time for have a Guildmaster for each shire.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.DCKXpxwiAjW5nF4Q"}}}
