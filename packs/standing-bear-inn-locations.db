{"_id":"OYh7wU7peK6H5hjy","name":"Inn - Second Floor","content":"<p>The second floor of the inn contains the private guest rooms, all identified with various heraldic beasts painted on the doors. The three finest rooms are more commonly known as the Red, White, and Green rooms. Each is richly furnished, primarily in the corresponding color. These rooms are popular with wealthy nobles and often are reserved months in advance. There are five additional rooms of varying sizes, each with multiple beds. These are less richly furnished but still quite comfortable. They are often vacant for large portions of the year.</p>\n<h2>[1] Corridor</h2>\n<p>There are two small privies for those wishing a little privacy. Several tapestries commemorate events from past tournaments.</p>\n<h2>[2] Lion Room</h2>\n<p>More commonly referred to as the White Room, this is the second-finest room in the inn and has a good view of the courtyard.</p>\n<h2>[3] Stag Room</h2>\n<p>Also known as the Green Room, this is considered the third-finest room in the inn. It has only two very small windows but is still very well appointed.</p>\n<h2>[4] Bear Room</h2>\n<p>The Red Room is regarded as the finest room in the inn and has excellent views of Mycepris Square and the castle. It is comparable in size and comfort to the solar of a wealthy baron.</p>\n<h2>[5] Bull Room</h2>\n<p>This small room does not have a fireplace and is used only in the summer.</p>\n<h2>[6] Boar Room</h2>\n<p>Although comfortable, this medium- sized room also lacks a fireplace and is closed up for the winter.</p>\n<h2>[7] Horse Room</h2>\n<p>A good room with a fireplace, this medium-sized chamber is home to the inn’s only live-in guest, Sir Gowen Karondal (see @Compendium[hm-loc-sbi.standing-bear-inn-actors.0NCGw1AjKnt0noH7]{507-8 Fighting Order MH - Sir Gowen Karondal}). The heat from the Great Hearth below keeps it toasty warm during the winter. Sir Gowen, 75, is an amiable, albeit slightly senile knight. A Venilana (retired knight) of the Order of the Lady of Paladins, Sir Gowen is a veteran of the Treasure War and is well regarded in Laranian circles. A table by the window features a beautifully crafted red and white Malnirala set (see Tavern Games), a gift from the order’s grandmaster. Sir Gowen enjoys entertaining visitors and regaling them with tales from his younger days. Sir Gowen is one of the few people that Haselun actually likes. He also appreciates that many of the Venilana’s visitors are nobles. Despite his generally cheerful personality, Sir Gowen bears a considerable animosity towards Chybisans, especially those who are members of the Order of the Lady of Paladins.</p>\n<h2>[8] Eagle Room</h2>\n<p>This medium-sized room is the second-most popular to rent during the off season.</p>\n<h2>[9] Fox Room</h2>\n<p>Except during the tournament, few parties are large enough to require this many beds. The room is rarely rented at other times.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.G2nAxVJKK2tWsJjm"}}}

The brewery offers ale from casks brewed before the tournament or “green” ale directly from the fermenters. The green ale is popular but sells out quickly; it takes a few days to brew a new batch.</p>\n<h2>[3] Fermenters</h2>\n<p>The wort is transferred to the next set of tuns, where it is left to ferment before finally being transferred into casks.</p>\n<h2>[4] Mash Tuns</h2>\n<p>Malted barley and oats are soaked in two wooden tuns to produce the wort. A trough carries the wort to the fermenters.</p>\n<h2>[5] Ovens</h2>\n<p>Two large ovens are used to roast the germinated barley.

The brewery has its own internal well to help ensure the water is kept free of contamination. Portable troughs can be used to direct the water from the well across to the far kettle.</p>\n<h2>[7] Brewmaster’s Hall</h2>\n<p>Although the room was originally intended solely for the brewmaster and his staff, Hugo welcomes the inn staff to join him here for a quiet drink at the end of the workday. Intimidated by the burly brewmaster, Haselun was loath to intrude and the gatherings soon became a refuge where the staff could relax away from the crazed innkeeper. The servants and brewery staff take their meals here.</p>\n<h2>[8] Staff Quarters</h2>\n<p>Journeyman innkeeper Faera and Kym the barman each have a single bed here. The bunk bed is reserved for Hugo’s journeyman, Bradlak (22), and apprentice, Shawe (14). Master Hugo is a generous and considerate master and both young men consider themselves very fortunate to be trained by him. Bradlak is well on his way to becoming an excellent brewmaster.</p>\n<h2>[9] Private Quarters</h2>\n<p>Hugo and Jonil have always shared this room, even before Faera and Kym moved in. The staff are all well aware of the two men’s relationship but guard their secret in thanks for Hugo protecting them from the worst of Haselun’s excesses. Jonil is an exceptional cook but slow and methodical. He frequently makes his delicious honey bread in the brewery ovens. It rarely lasts long, but he is sure to set a loaf aside for Wynda.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.C5sujc7pJTvvrC68"}},"_id":"iTzjtvdxYOBYlkCJ"}

Esyra is a devout Peonian with a lovely voice and loves to sing while she works. She is often joined by the assistant cook, her cousin Urma; this sometimes results in cheers and applause from patrons who overhear from the common room or bar.</p>\n<h2>[9] Tourney Kitchen</h2>\n<p>This room is used to prepare food during the annual tournament and is rarely used for the rest of the year.
